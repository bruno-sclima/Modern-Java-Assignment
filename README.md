# Modern-Java-Assignment
Simple Blockchain in Java for Avenue Code Academy - Java Essentials

## What should be done in this assignment?
- You should use the articles linked below as reference to implement a Simple Blockchain in Java
- Multiple miners should run in parallel to insert a block in the chain.
- The chain must accept a new block only if it was generated using the hash of its last block as seed.
- It should be implemented as a Java library and called blockchain.jar.
- Create a separate jar using Java Concurrency to simulate multiple miners trying to add new blocks to the chain at the same time.
- It should be implemented as a Java console application called miners.jar.

What do we expect to see in this assignment?
- Use Local Variable Type Inference as much as possible.
- Use Lambda Expressions along with the Streams API.
- Use some of the new features of the Collections API, introduced after Java 8.
- Use some Java Concurrency to run multiple miners in parallel
